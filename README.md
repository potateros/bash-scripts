# bash-scripts
Assorted bash scripts I have created 👩‍💻

## Scripts
These are arranged in order of creation date, sooo it's gonna be a lil messy

`magpi-download.sh` - Downloads every MagPi issue until issue no.75. Just a little script I made cos lazy.

`upedit.sh` - Downloads and updates VSCode for me. Initially had Atom and Dropbox, but since I don't need to update them anymore, has been commented out.

`wallchanger` - Picks a random image from the `~/Picuteres/Wallpapers/` folder, copies it to another folder, then sets it as the current wallpaper. Made this so that I can have a cron job that changes wallpaper every hour, because Ubuntu does not support custom folder auto-wallchanger. 🤷

`work.sh` - Basically opens all the stuff that I have to go through each day for work (emails, Slack, calendar, todo list, etc). 🤓
